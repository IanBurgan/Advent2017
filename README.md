# Advent of Code 2017

Solutions for all 25 of the puzzles posted as part of Advent of Code
2015. Participate at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)

In order to make it onto the top 100 leaderboard,
I solved the problems as quickly as I can. As you can imagine,
this led to less than beautiful code and maybe even sometimes,
dare I say it, bad practices. I apologize in advance :).

## Leaderboard Position:

Only the first 100 completions are displayed on the public leaderboard.
For any ranks greater than 100, you're just going to have to trust me. Rank 1
is my ranking on the first star. Similarly, Rank 2 is my ranking on the second
star. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to _compete_ on days 1, 2, and 3.

|Day    |Rank 1 |Rank 2 |
|------:|------:|------:|
|1      |22872  |19308  |
|2      |14538  |12637  |
|3      |11335  |8048   |
|4      |170    |313    |
|5      |906    |774    |
